1. Navigate to your shared container folder and create a new file. The name is up to you, but the file_type(file_ending) needs to be `.rb`.
   Which is the abbreviation for ruby.

2. We created a file named: [`lesson-5.rb`](/lessons/examples/lesson-5.rb)

3. Then open the file in your preferred editor. We recommend again [Atom](https://atom.io). :)
   We added the following for example:
   ```ruby
   puts "Hello World"
   ```

4. Now run your container as always and type:
   ```shell
   ruby lesson-5.rb
   ```
