# Lesson 9

## Classes

In many programming languages there are classes which define the properties of their instances, also known as objects.
Think of a class like a template and an object as a specific thing of a certain class. For example we could define a class
called `Hardware` and one instance of this class could be a laptop. People are using different laptops,
but all of them are a kind of `Hardware`.

In ruby a class is defined as follows:

```ruby
class Hardware
  def initialize(weight)
    @weight = weight
  end
  
  def weight
    @weight
  end
end
```

|Part|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|class|keyword|keyword to start a class|
|Hardware|class name|Your name of the class|
|def initialize|constructor method|This method is used to create **new** instances of the class|
|@weight|instance variable|A variable that only exists within a specific instance of a class|
|def weight|method|In this example the `weight` method can be used to get the value of the specific `Hardware`|
|end|keyword|Keyword to end a class. Just like you would end a method or a block for example.|

If you want to set the value of an instance variable then a setter method is required:

```diff
class Hardware
  def initialize(weight)
    @weight = weight
  end
  
  def weight
    @weight
  end
  
+ def weight=(new_weight)
+   @weight = new_weight
+ end
end
```

The new `weight=` method allows to set the `weight` attribute of an existing instance to a new value:

```ruby
laptop = Hardware.new(10)
laptop.weight # => 10
laptop.weight=(5)
laptop.weight # => 5
```

`laptop.weight = 5` is just a fancy way of calling `laptop.weight=(5)`.
This is also how methods ending in `=` are usually called.
Calling the method this way makes it more look like a variable is being set that just happens to belong to an instance.

## Objects

To create a new instance of a class call the `new` method on it:

```ruby
laptop1 = Hardware.new(5)
laptop1.weight # => 5
```

Every class implicitly has a `new` method. Counter-intuitively to implement it the for it needs to
go into a method called `initialize`. Ruby magically directs a call of `new` on a class to its `initialize` method.

Each instance of a class can be considered independent of its likes:

```ruby
laptop1.weight # => 5 (from above)
laptop2 = Hardware.new(10)
laptop2.weight # => 10
laptop1 == laptop2 # => false
```

As you can see the two instances are not equal.
