## Variables

Every practical programming language has a feature to do this, called variables.
This is basically the same concept that you might know from math, although in
Ruby there are different kinds of variables (you will get to know another one in
a couple chapters).

In Ruby you can assign a name to something (an object) by using the so called
assignment operator =.

```ruby
# An Integer
number = 1
# A Text
text = 'Hallo World'
# A Boolean
is_mentor = true
```
