## General
In this lessons we like shope a little bit on the `death star` ‚≠ê with VADER DOLLAR üí≤.
For this we will create a shopping list, where we have items we like to buy in there, for example:
```
milk, eggs, sausage, juice, cheese, Lightsaber, Tie-Figther, ...
```

## Part 1:

At the end of the lesson we like to have all of this things in our basket.

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

```ruby
# full shopping list
shopping_list = ["milk", "eggs", "sausage", "juice", "cheese"]

# empty shopping basket
shopping_basket = []
```

```ruby
shopping_list.each do |shopping_item|
  shopping_basket.add(shopping_item)
end

puts shopping_basket
```

## Hashes

What are hashes in Ruby. Think as them as dictionaries or key value stores. Using a key, you can find the related value. For example in a dictonary:
```
hello => Hallo
day => Tag
```

This looks like this in ruby:
```ruby
{ "hello" => "Hallo", "day" => "Tag" }
```

The syntax for accessing the hash looks similar to an array. The difference is that with an array we search via index, whereas in a hash we search by key.

```ruby
dictonary = { "hello" => "Hallo", "day" => "Tag" }
dictonary["hello"]
=> "Hallo"
```

If the key your are looking for is not defined, ruby will return `nil`.
```ruby
dictonary = { "hello" => "Hallo", "day" => "Tag" }
dictonary["month"]
=> nil
```

|Part|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`{`|keyword|Beginning of a hash|
|"hello"|key|your defined key for a key value pair|
|`=>`|seperator|lets ruby know that the key ends here and the value comes next ('hash rocket')|
|"hello"|value|the assigned value to your defined key|
|`}`|keyword|end of a hash|

The keys and values of hashes can be everything.
## Part 2:

We also like to get the prices of the products to see how much we will pay at the end.

```ruby
shop_products = { "milk" => 1.5, "juice" => 1.2, "cheese" => 1.7 }

shopping_list = ["milk", "eggs", "sausage", "juice", "cheese"]
shopping_basket = []

not_available_products = []
total_price = 0

shopping_list.each do |shopping_item|
  if shop_products.keys.include?(shopping_item)
    shopping_basket.push(shopping_item)
    total_price = total_price + shop_products[shopping_item]
  else
    not_available_products.push(shopping_item)
  end
end

puts "You need to pay: #{total_price} VADER DOLLAR."
# You need to pay: 4.4 VADER DOLLAR.
 => nil
puts "The following items you bought: #{shopping_basket.join(", ")}"
# The following items you bought: milk, juice, cheese
 => nil
puts "The shop has non of these products: #{not_available_products.join(", ")}"
# The shop has non of these products: eggs, sausage
 => nil
```
