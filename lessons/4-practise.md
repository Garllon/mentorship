## General
In this lesson we'd like to shope a little bit on the `death star` ‚≠ê with VADER DOLLAR üí≤.
For this we will create a shopping list, where we have items we like to buy in there, for example:
```
milk, eggs, sausage, juice, cheese, Lightsaber, TIE Fighter, ...
```

## Going Shopping:

Imagine you are now in the shop and like to buy all the items on your list.
At the end we like to have all items from our list in our basket.

<details>
<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

```ruby
# full shopping list
shopping_list = ["milk", "eggs", "sausage", "juice", "cheese"]

# empty shopping basket
shopping_basket = []
```

```ruby
shopping_list.each do |shopping_item|
  shopping_basket.push(shopping_item)
end
 => ["milk", "eggs", "sausage", "juice", "cheese"]

puts shopping_basket
# milk
# eggs
# sausage
# juice
# cheese
 => nil
```


The `.each` is returning the list you looped over as return value.
Check the documenation for the behaviour of other loops.

## Hashes

What are hashes in Ruby. Think of them as dictionaries or key value stores. Using a key, you can find the related value. For example in a dictonary:
```
hello => Hallo
day => Tag
```

This looks like this in ruby:
```ruby
{ "hello" => "Hallo", "day" => "Tag" }
```

The syntax for accessing the hash looks similar to an array. The difference is that with an array we search via index, whereas in a hash we search by key.

```ruby
dictonary = { "hello" => "Hallo", "day" => "Tag" }
dictonary["hello"]
=> "Hallo"
```

If the key your are looking for is not defined, ruby will return `nil`.
```ruby
dictonary = { "hello" => "Hallo", "day" => "Tag" }
dictonary["month"]
=> nil
```

|Part|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`{`|keyword|Beginning of a hash|
|"hello"|key|your defined key for a key value pair|
|`=>`|seperator|lets ruby know that the key ends here and the value comes next ('hash rocket')|
|"hello"|value|the assigned value to your defined key|
|`}`|keyword|end of a hash|

The keys and values of hashes can be everything.
## Cashing out:

The same situation as in [Going Shopping](#going-shopping), but now we also like to know the total price of all items we can buy and also a new list, with items which are not available. Here is a list of products with prices:

- milk => 1.5
- juice => 1.2
- cheese => 1.7
- eggs => 1
- sausage => 3.7

All prices are of course in VADER DOLLAR üí≤.

<details>
<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

```ruby
shop_products = { "milk" => 1.5, "juice" => 1.2, "cheese" => 1.7, "eggs" => 1, "sausage" => 3.7 }

shopping_list = ["milk", "eggs", "sausage", "juice", "cheese", "Lightsaber", "TIE Fighter"]
shopping_basket = []

not_available_products = []
total_price = 0

shopping_list.each do |shopping_item|
  if shop_products.keys.include?(shopping_item)
    shopping_basket.push(shopping_item)
    total_price = total_price + shop_products[shopping_item]
  else
    not_available_products.push(shopping_item)
  end
end

puts "You need to pay: #{total_price} VD (VADER DOLLAR)."
# You need to pay: 9.0 VD (VADER DOLLAR).
 => nil
puts "You bought the following items: #{shopping_basket.join(", ")}"
# You bought the following items: milk, eggs, sausage, juice, cheese
 => nil
puts "The shop has none of these products: #{not_available_products.join(", ")} :("
# The shop has none of these products: Lightsaber, TIE Fighter :(
 => nil
```

## Homework

Imagine you're about to buy a new desk. You have a monitor on your current desk, but you know you'll want to replace
that one with a bigger model some time in the future. But first you want a shiny new desk! In order to make sure
the new desk can fit the future monitor comfortably you need to figure out the width of it. Unfortunately all you about
the mystical new monitor is it's diagonal (e.g. 32 inches) and it's aspect ratio (e.g. 16 by 9). 

**The (optional üòâ) homework:**

Write a method which can calculate the minimum width of the new desk based on
the information available about the new monitor that should eventually be placed on top of it.

*Bonus 1: Assume the diagonal is given in inches and return the minimum width in centimeters*

*Bonus 2: Extend your method so that it also works when more than one monitor should be placed on the desk*
