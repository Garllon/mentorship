Navigate to your shared container folder and create a new file. The name is up to you, but the file_type(file_ending) needs to be `.rb`.
Which is the abbreviation for ruby.

We created a file named: `lesson-5.rb`

Then open the file in your preferred editor. We recommend again [Atom](https://atom.io). :)
We added the following for example:
```ruby
puts "Hello World"
```

Now run your container as always and type:
```shell
ruby lesson-5.rb
```
